# The Good Morrow
This is an island hotel like no other. Here you can become one with the island and prove John Donne wrong. The perfect site for the perfect hotel in fact. You can book rooms and order extras like poems and a music video.

This is a school project made by a student of the Yrgo Webdesign Class of 22. More info can be found at https://www.yrgopelago.se/

# Instructions
The site is live at http://www.garagehider.com/good-morrow/

There is an API that can be reached at http://www.garagehider.com/good-morrow/api/bookings.php
All info needed to use it can be read there or in the .json response from making a post request.

If you want to run a copy of this site you'll need to make your own .env file containing an API key for the yrgopelago central bank and also a link to a tasty music video of your own making. You'll also need to install several .php packages and run the site on a .php server.
